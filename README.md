# Arduino Tutorials
### August Ning
Decently simple Arduino tutorials that I have taught for Duke IEEE and HackDuke. Goes over digital and analog concepts, introduces wiring, programming, and Servo libraries.

Currently the code isn't commented, but followed along with any tutorial slides (I recommend the IEEE pdf) and the wiring and coding is explained in there.

Required Materials:
* Arduino (I used Arduino Unos)
* Arduino IDE
* Standard breadboard
* 1 220 Ohm resistor
* 1 LED
* 1 Photoresistor
* 1 Piezobuzzer
* 1 Standard Servo (Continuous Servo can work too)

## 01 - LED Blink
## 02 - LED Fade
## 03 - Photoresistor Read
## 04 - Photoresistor Tone
## 05 - Servo
